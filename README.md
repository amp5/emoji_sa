# QMSS_emoji_sa

This git repo contains all relevant data files, reports and graphics pertaining to my Master's thesis for Columbia University's Quantitative Methods in Social Science program. My project focuses on comparing the difference between sentiment analysis of text and emoji in a single tweet.

More information about this project will be added at a later date. 

For more specific information see Notebook.md for a daily log of process.
