**Assignment 1**
Thesis Class Comments:

Hi Alessandra,

sounds good. I would recommend thinking about two issues: how many tweets/user and what do you do with very heavy tweeters? 
Tweeter data is usually heavily skewed and when you take a tweet as your unit of analysis you tend to overlook this fact.

The second issue is: what do you do with bots and tweets that come from organizations promoting an issue or candidate? 
Again, since your unit of analysis is a tweet, who is issuing it may become obscured in your analysis.


Peer Review Comments:

Is the table of key words below the hashtags or just general key words in tweets?
I don't think you need the th or the nd, but that's a stylistic call.
If someone reads this in 2018 or later "last year" might be odd.  You could say "early that year" instead?
Neither (because the next clause begins with nor)
or?
Not necessary to discuss here but what happens if a tweet is in another language?
Will you make an attempt to isolate American users that don't geolocate their tweets?
identified as sent?
Helpful context!
unique is unnecessary 
What are your views on oxford commas?
Does this require exact matches? If someone uses #hillary would that tweet get tagged because of hillary as a key word or would
it require the # as well?  You might want to include # or the @ for their actual account names if they require exact matches.
John Oliver had a Drumpf campaign if you are looking for more data :)
I think you explain the dataset very clearly.  I am only confused by the way you will subset your data. 
In the first paragraph you say hashtags and in the table you use key words. 
Are you limiting the analysis to tweets that mention the candidates in either or both ways?  That could be a little more explicit.  



**Assignment 2** - Lit Review
This is a good start.  I would try to build out your hypothesis and provide evidence to support it.  That is, what do you expect to find and why?  Do you think that studying tweets as opposed to texts will change your results?  And if so in what way?  Any studies that compare studies that compare tweets vs texts (even if it is not about emojis or even if sentiment analysis is not the main methodology employed)?
